Selenium Webdriver hacks for daily testing.


These are code snippets to demonstrate the small hacks that can be used for handling waits in optimum way, image rendition validation, dynamic locators, browser specific locators. The approaches are based on page object design pattern in the background and are explained with code snippets. 

1.	Keep implicit and explicit wait separate by setting timeouts in reusable methods.
2.	Handling browser specific locators:
a.	Testcase code dependent on browser
b.	Using Separate locator repository
3.	Approach for keeping common tests across pages separate and running from a static context.
4.	Approaches for handling dynamic xpath including Jquery XPATH 2.0 plugin for using regex in Xpath, Parametrizing by overriding FindBy
5.	Image rendering validation using Javascript
